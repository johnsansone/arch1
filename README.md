# arch1
These are three projects that i had to do for arch1. This semester has been rough as I am also takeing software 1 so I had no time for these projects. The first two work with the second ones assembly affecting the led brightness for no reason. The final game I found a memory issue that does not allow me to use structs and the only way to use a singular struct in the way we are supposed to is by mallocing everything. I plan to come back and fix these issues as time allows and when i get a msp430.
